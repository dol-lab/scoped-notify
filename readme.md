# Scoped Notify

A WordPress plugin designed to provide granular control over notifications for new posts and comments within a WordPress network environment with many users.

## Features

*   **Scoped Notifications:** Allows registered users to fine-tune their notification preferences. Decide whether to receive notifications for posts and comments at different levels:
    *   Entire network (platform-wide)
    *   Specific blogs within the network
    *   Specific terms (categories/tags)
    *   Individual posts (for comment notifications)
*   **Specificity Rules:** The most specific notification setting always takes precedence (e.g., a post-level setting overrides a blog-level setting).
*   **Network-Wide:** Operates at the network level, adding custom tables to manage settings centrally without blog-specific tables.
*   **User-Focused:** Designed for logged-in users to manage their own notifications.
